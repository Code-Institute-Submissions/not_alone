# I Am Not Alone README.

## Overview

### Why does I Am Not Alone exist?
In my opinion, mental illness is not discussed openly or often enough without fear or embarassment. I hope this site can go some way to eliminating the stigma, and toward assuring people that they are not alone in this.

### Further thoughts on site design
I want the site to be bright, airy and happy - People are coming there to leave with a new lease on life, so it doesn't need to be all doom and gloom and boring facts and figures, similar to what I've been met with in the past when looking for advice - it's going to be an open forum where people can discuss their experiences, and that includes how amazing they feel after coming out the other side, as well as genuine care and support during our lowest moments. In terms of the human race as a whole, we generally all care about each other - we just need a platform that gives us the opportunity to show that. This will be a good place to be.

### What does the code do?
The code contained in these files will display information through the immediacy and accessibility of data visualisation graphs and tables, as well as provide links and solutions for people looking for help.

## Features

Features include the ability to take a tour in the charts section, and dynamically alter the charts output bys selecting different regions on the pie chart.

###Features Left to Implement
1. Blog section where users can contribute.
2. Login/Logout/Register.

## Contributing:
Please feel free to contribute! You can find me under alexmiller64 on github, and the project under the not_alone repository.
Please feel free to make any changes or additions you see fit, then submit a pull request.

### Getting the code up and running
1. Firstly you will need to clone this repository by running the ```git clone <project's Github URL>``` command
2. After you've that you'll need to make sure that you have **npm** and **bower** installed
  1. You can get **npm** by installing Node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  2. Once you've done this you'll need to run the following command:
  	 `npm install -g bower # this may require sudo on Mac/Linux`
3. Once **npm** and **bower** are installed, you'll need to install all of the dependencies in *package.json* and *bower.json*
  ```
  npm install

  bower install
  ```
4. After those dependencies have been installed you'll need to make sure that you have **http-server** installed. You can install this by running the following: ```npm install -g http-server # this also may require sudo on Mac/Linux```
5. Once **http-server** is installed run ```http-server```
6. The project will now run on [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
7. Make changes to the code and if you think it belongs in here then just submit a pull request
